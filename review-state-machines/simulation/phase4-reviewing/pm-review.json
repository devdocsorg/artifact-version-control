  "body": "Thorough doc. Covers the user journey well.\n\n**PM Checklist Results:**\n\n✅ **Basic Workflows** — Create webhook via API and UI both fully documented. Clear start-to-finish path.\n\n✅ **Advanced Workflows** — Event type filtering, signature verification with code samples in 3 languages, retry configuration. Good coverage for power users.\n\n✅ **User Troubleshooting** — Three troubleshooting scenarios with actionable steps. The body-parsing middleware section is the kind of thing that prevents support tickets. Love it.\n\n✅ **Outcome Guarantees** — Clear about what webhooks do and don't do. Payload truncation caveat at 256KB is important — glad it's documented.\n\n✅ **UI Reference Accuracy** — Settings → Integrations → Webhooks path matches current UI. Checked against staging.\n\n✅ **Workflow Pages Accuracy** — Consistent with DOC-202 (UI Reference) and DOC-203 (User Workflow) which are in draft. No contradictions.\n\n**One non-blocking note:** We should consider adding a 'Webhook vs. Polling' comparison table in a future update. Not required for this PR.\n\nApproved! 🚀",

      "body": "✅ Good — you mentioned payload truncation at 256KB and the auto-disable at 95% failure rate. These are the kind of limitations users need to know about upfront. One thought for a follow-up: we should link to the upcoming 'Webhook Filtering' doc (DOC-204, v4.4) in a 'Coming Soon' note so users know transformation is on the roadmap."
