[ADDED: New file]
Additions:
- Complete new test file for the formatters module
- 7 test cases across 4 test classes:
  - TestFormatJson: basic JSON output, pretty-print
  - TestFormatJsonl: basic JSONL output
  - TestFormatYaml: basic YAML, readability check, type preservation
  - TestFormatInvalid: unknown format error handling
Reason: The formatters module previously had no dedicated tests. Adding YAML support 
was the catalyst to create comprehensive formatter tests.
