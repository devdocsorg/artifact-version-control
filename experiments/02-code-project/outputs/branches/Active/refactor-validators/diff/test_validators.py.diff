[MODIFIED: Entire file rewritten]
Changes:
- Replaced direct tests with backward compatibility verification tests
- Now tests that the validators.py shim correctly re-exports all functions
Reason: The real tests live in test_schema_validators.py and test_type_validators.py now.
This file verifies the shim still works.
---
BEFORE:
- TestValidateFilePath: 5 tests (direct function tests)
- TestValidateOutputFormat: 3 tests + 1 yaml test (direct function tests)
---
AFTER:
- TestBackwardCompatibility: 5 tests (import verification only)
