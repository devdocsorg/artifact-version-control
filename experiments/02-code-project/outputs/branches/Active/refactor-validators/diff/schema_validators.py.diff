[ADDED: New file — csvjson/schema_validators.py]
Additions:
- validate_file_path() — moved from validators.py (logic unchanged)
- validate_csv_structure() — NEW function, validates CSV has content
Reason: Separation of concerns — file/structure validation in one module
---
(See full file: csvjson/schema_validators.py — 58 lines)

Code movement note: validate_file_path() is identical to the original in validators.py.
Only validate_csv_structure() is genuinely new code.
