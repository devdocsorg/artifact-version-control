[ADDED: New file — csvjson/type_validators.py]
Additions:
- SUPPORTED_FORMATS list — moved from validators.py (unchanged)
- VALID_DELIMITERS list — NEW constant
- validate_output_format() — moved from validators.py (logic unchanged)
- validate_delimiter() — NEW function, validates delimiter character
Reason: Separation of concerns — type/format validation in one module
---
(See full file: csvjson/type_validators.py — 50 lines)

Code movement note: validate_output_format() and SUPPORTED_FORMATS are identical
to the originals in validators.py. Only validate_delimiter() and VALID_DELIMITERS
are genuinely new code.
